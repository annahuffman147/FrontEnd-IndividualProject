# Galvanize Individual Project Proposal

## Project Description
	Create an educational game in which users can select appropriate clothes based on the current weather. Yahoo Weather API will provide the data.  

	The final version will have three developmental levels. 

	The minimum viable product for the first week sprint is only level one. Level one is image based. 

	If time is available, level two will add text and numbers to images. Complexity can be added with a click element reads 

	A hidden feature for parents will include the full forecast without leaving the application.
